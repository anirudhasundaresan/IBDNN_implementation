For checking the correctness of codes, please do the following: 

- For running the code and to get results:
	- Download the codes from: https://github.com/artemyk/ibsgd/tree/iclr2018
	- Download the docker image from: https://hub.docker.com/r/ermaker/keras/tags
	- Make the following modifications within the docker: 
		(for working with IBSGD code - final output obtained with this)
		- mount code directory with some amount of space reserved for the rawdata and logs [~1.6GB]
		- Use docker image: ermaker/keras with tag='gpu' --> it has py3
		- pip install seaborn (also installs matplotlib), pathlib2
		- convert all cPickle to pickle (codes are in py2, manually change this to ensure that it works in py3)
		- convert ipynb to .py files - jupyter nbconvert --to script '<name_of_file>.ipynb'
		- run with: python MNIST_SaveActivations 2>&1 | tee train.log && python MNIST_ComputeMI 2>&1 | tee info.log 
		- play around with different network archs and relu/tanh

- To just observe results on fashion_mnist data: 
	- check out figures in ibsgd-iclr2018/plots/
	- check out train.log and info.log - has all information on the training procedures

Also, check out:
	- instructions for problem statement 
	- references for links/ codes that helped me understand
	- IDNN.pdf for the original paper proposing this idea 
	- notes for personal use, to keep track of stuff
