Instructions for this challenge:
--------------------------------

- Cite works of others; you can use them; provide a link
- Concentrate on implementation designs, and reasoning behind them rather than on accuracy scores

Challenge:
Design a deep-net that obtains high accuracy predictions for the Fashion MNIST dataset [1]. (There are lots of pre-written architectures that you can use as well).
Obtain the information plane visualization (See Fig 5 in [2]) of the layers' information paths during SGD optimization for the deep-net designed above.
