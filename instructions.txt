Instructions, References and Reminders for this challenge:
----------------------------------------------------------

- Cite works of others; you can use them; provide a link
- Concentrate on implementation designs, and reasoning behind them rather than on accuracy scores

Challenge:
Design a deep-net that obtains high accuracy predictions for the Fashion MNIST dataset [1]. (There are lots of pre-written architectures that you can use as well).
Obtain the information plane visualization (See Fig 5 in [2]) of the layers' information paths during SGD optimization for the deep-net designed above.

[3] http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6085/student_slides/IFT6085_Presentation_IB.pdf -- very good presentation detailing the above work
[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07747.pdf -- paper introducing the fashion-MNIST dataset (and how it was prepared, to be in the flavor of MNIST)
[5] https://github.com/ravidziv/IDNNs -- implementation of the IDNN paper, straight from the authors! -- seems to have a bad rap as people are not able to reproduce this effectively,
need to check it out.
[6] https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_WPG-A- -- wow, more discussions on the correctness of this paper, now I am skeptical. Probably, my results might also disprove the paper? since I
don't think this has been done with the fashion_mnist set

and has also included a version he feels is better @https://github.com/artemyk/ibsgd/tree/iclr2018

Personal reminders:
- Upload git bundle and Jupyter notebook
- Make sure there are comments explaining every loc
- Upload by Monday 7pm
- Understand why I am doing this; how it relates to the job
- Send git link, so they can track progress [Done]
- Send an update to C????? and V???? after you finish the codes

Notes:
- The two references seem to be unrelated; the [2] is an application for [1] - surface level realization [Done]
- Make sure you are running this on fashion dataset and not on MNIST
- Go through issues in the main repo before choosing an architecture
  - Try the IDNN architecture with the MNIST data first; see if you are able to reproduce results (https://github.com/ravidziv/IDNNs)
  - Try the IDNN with fashion_MNIST data and see if you can get it working
  - Try ibsgd with MNIST and see if you can replicate work (https://github.com/artemyk/ibsgd/tree/iclr2018)
  - Try ibsgd with fashion_MNIST and see if you can replicate work

Plan of action:
- Read through [1], read through [2], and then try implementations
- You will need an architecture that can help you visualize what's being asked from [2] - best to use the architecture used by the authors themselves!

Coding specifics:
- Using docker image: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-py3
- Latest commit for this code is on Nov-2017. Make changes to the code for issues after that date.
    - Changed 'parmas' to 'params' - change in code required
- Removed existing docker : tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu, since this code is in py3 and system required more space.
- Within the docker:
    - Installed joblib (pip install joblib)
    - Installed tkinter, but required a update first (apt-get update && apt-get install python3-tk)
- Made changes in idnns/networks/utils.py to get this working with fashion_mnist dataset.
