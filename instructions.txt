Instructions, References and Reminders for this challenge:
----------------------------------------------------------

- Cite works of others; you can use them; provide a link
- Concentrate on implementation designs, and reasoning behind them rather than on accuracy scores

Challenge:
Design a deep-net that obtains high accuracy predictions for the Fashion MNIST dataset [1]. (There are lots of pre-written architectures that you can use as well).
Obtain the information plane visualization (See Fig 5 in [2]) of the layers' information paths during SGD optimization for the deep-net designed above.

[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07747.pdf -- paper introducing the fashion-MNIST dataset (and how it was prepared, to be in the flavor of MNIST)

Personal reminders:
- Upload git bundle and Jupyter notebook
- Make sure there are comments explaining every loc
- Upload by Monday 7pm
- Understand why I am doing this; how it relates to the job
- Send an update to C????? and V???? after you finish the codes

Notes:
- The two references seem to be unrelated; the [2] is an application for [1] - surface level realization
- Make sure you are running this on fashion dataset and not on MNIST
- Go through issues in the main repo before choosing an architecture

Plan of action:
- Read through [1], read through [2], and then try implementations
- You will need an architecture that can help you visualize what's being asked from [2]
