[3] http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6085/student_slides/IFT6085_Presentation_IB.pdf -- very good presentation detailing the above work

[5] https://github.com/ravidziv/IDNNs -- implementation of the IDNN paper, straight from the authors! -- seems to have a bad rap as people are not able to reproduce this effectively,
need to check it out.
[6] https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_WPG-A- -- wow, more discussions on the correctness of this paper, now I am skeptical. Probably, my results might also disprove the paper? since I
don't think this has been done with the fashion_mnist set

[8] https://planspace.org/20180213-failure_to_replicate_schwartz-ziv_and_tishby/ -- this guy had some trouble with implementation of the IB paper and has expressed his concerns,
and has also included a version he feels is better @https://github.com/artemyk/ibsgd/tree/iclr2018
